# pandemicrate
working on starting a website with just the very basics to work on learning and applying HTML (have no HTML experience, but some experience in Python).  For starters, I want to bring together several sources that measure different Coronavirus Pandemic data, and reorganize them for display in one central location.  Open to collaboration!
